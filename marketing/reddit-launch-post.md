# Reddit Launch Post — VendRadar

**Target Subreddits:** r/vending, r/sweatystartup, r/entrepreneur  
**Post Time:** Tuesday or Thursday, 10 AM - 2 PM EST (high traffic)  
**Tone:** Authentic, helpful, not sales-y

## VERSION A: Problem-First (r/vending)

**Title:** I wasted $2,000 placing vending machines in "high traffic" locations that flopped. Built a tool so you don't have to.

**Body:**

Hey r/vending,

Three years ago I started a small vending route. My first machine? Placed it in a gym parking lot because "gyms = high traffic, right?"

Wrong. $50/month revenue. Barely covered restocking gas.

My second machine? Office building lobby. Manager said "200 employees, they'll love it!" 

$80/month. Still not profitable.

I realized I was guessing. Everyone said "high foot traffic" but nobody actually *measured* it.

So I spent the last 6 months building **VendRadar** — a tool that shows actual foot traffic data for potential vending locations. Think Google Maps heat map, but for finding profitable spots.

**What it does:**
- Shows foot traffic patterns by day/hour (so you know peak times)
- Compares locations side-by-side (Location A vs B)
- Filters by demographics (income level, age, foot traffic type)
- ROI calculator (estimates monthly revenue based on traffic + machine type)

**Why I'm posting this:**
I'm launching a free beta on Feb 24th. Looking for 50 vending operators to test it and give feedback.

Not selling anything (yet). Just want to make sure this actually solves the problem before I charge for it.

If you've ever placed a machine in a "sure thing" location that underperformed, this is for you.

**Free beta signup:** [vendradar.com/beta]

Happy to answer any questions. And if this violates any rules, mods feel free to delete — genuinely just trying to solve a problem I know we all have.

## VERSION B: Data-First (r/sweatystartup, r/entrepreneur)

**Title:** I analyzed foot traffic data from 500 vending machine locations. Here's what I learned (+ free tool for operators).

**Body:**

I've been running a side hustle vending route for 3 years. Last year I got obsessed with *why* some machines make $500/month and others barely break even.

So I pulled foot traffic data for 500+ vending locations and found some patterns:

**🔍 What I learned:**

1. **"High traffic" ≠ high sales.** A mall food court has 10,000 people/day, but 80% are just passing through. A gym locker room has 500/day, but 90% stop and browse. Dwell time matters more than raw numbers.

2. **Time of day is everything.** Office buildings: dead after 6 PM. Gyms: peak 5-8 PM. Colleges: random chaos. Matching your machine to location rhythm = 2-3x revenue.

3. **Demographics matter less than you think.** Low-income areas bought just as much as high-income (just different products). The real filter is *impulse + need* — hungry college students >> wealthy people in a hurry.

4. **Competition hides in plain sight.** I placed a snack machine next to a Starbucks. Failed miserably. Why? Free coffee bar 50 feet away. Always check adjacent businesses.

**💡 What I built:**

I got tired of guessing, so I built **VendRadar** — a tool that shows foot traffic heat maps for any location you're considering.

You type in an address → it shows:
- Foot traffic by hour/day
- Nearby competition (cafeterias, vending, stores)
- Demographics (age, income, spend patterns)
- ROI estimate (expected monthly revenue)

**Why I'm sharing this:**

I'm launching a free beta on Feb 24th and need 50 operators to test it. Not charging anything yet — I just want to make sure it actually works before I build a business around it.

If you've ever lost money on a bad vending location (or are thinking about starting), sign up here: [vendradar.com/beta]

Also happy to share more data insights if anyone's interested. AMA about vending location selection.

## VERSION C: Story-First (r/entrepreneur)

**Title:** Turned my failed vending side hustle into a SaaS tool. Launching free beta next week.

**Body:**

**The problem:**

I started a vending machine side hustle in 2023. Bought 3 machines, placed them in "high traffic" spots (gym, office, mall food court).

After 6 months:
- Machine 1: $50/month (barely profitable)
- Machine 2: $80/month (meh)
- Machine 3: $320/month (finally!)

I had no idea why #3 worked and #1/#2 didn't. They all had "lots of people" walking by.

**The insight:**

I started tracking foot traffic manually (literally sat in each location for 4 hours with a clicker). 

Turns out:
- Machine 1 (gym): 500 people/day, but 90% went straight to workout (no browsing)
- Machine 2 (office): 200 people/day, but only during lunch hour (11-1 PM)
- Machine 3 (college library): 300 people/day, but they *loitered* — study breaks = impulse buys

**Raw foot traffic didn't matter. Dwell time + intent mattered.**

But nobody sells that data for vending operators. All the "site selection" advice is just "pick a busy spot lol."

**The solution:**

I spent 6 months building **VendRadar** — foot traffic analytics for vending location selection.

You enter an address, it shows:
- Foot traffic heat map (by hour/day)
- Dwell time estimates
- Nearby competition
- ROI calculator (expected monthly revenue)

Think: "Google Analytics for physical locations."

**The launch:**

Launching free beta Feb 24th. Need 50 operators to test it.

Not charging anything yet — want to validate product-market fit before building a paid plan.

**Why this might actually work:**

1. Vending is a $7B industry in the US alone
2. Most operators are solo/small teams (not data-savvy)
3. They lose $1,000+ per bad location (sunk cost of machine placement)
4. No competing tools (everyone just guesses or pays $500 for a "consultant")

**The ask:**

If you operate vending machines (or know someone who does), I'd love your feedback: [vendradar.com/beta]

Also happy to answer questions about vending, SaaS, or location data. Fire away.

## COMMENT RESPONSE TEMPLATES

**If someone asks about pricing:**
> "Right now it's free beta (Feb 24 launch). After that, thinking $29-49/month for operators with 1-10 machines. Still figuring out pricing based on feedback. Want to make sure it's actually worth it first."

**If someone asks about data accuracy:**
> "Good question. I'm pulling from [data source — e.g., SafeGraph, Foursquare, etc.]. It's not perfect (no dataset is), but it's way better than guessing. Beta users will help me refine accuracy."

**If someone is skeptical:**
> "Totally fair. I was skeptical of 'data tools' too until I wasted $2K on bad spots. Happy to show you a demo or run a location analysis for free if you want to test it before signing up."

**If someone shares their own bad location story:**
> "Oof, I feel that. [Empathize with their story]. That's exactly why I built this — nobody should lose money because they trusted a gym manager's 'trust me, it's busy here.'"

**If someone asks for tips (not related to product):**
> [Give genuinely helpful advice, end with] "If you want data on a specific location, I'm happy to run it through VendRadar for free (beta testing). DM me."
