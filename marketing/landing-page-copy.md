## PROBLEM SECTION

### Headline
**The #1 Reason Vending Machines Fail? Bad Locations.**

### Body Copy
You place a machine in a "high traffic" area. The manager promises foot traffic. The location *looks* busy.

Three months later: $60/month revenue. Barely profitable.

**Here's why:**

❌ "High traffic" doesn't mean high sales. A mall food court has 10,000 people/day — but 90% are just passing through.  
❌ You can't see peak hours. An office building is dead after 6 PM. A gym is empty at noon.  
❌ Competition hides in plain sight. That "perfect" spot is 50 feet from a free coffee bar.  

**Result:** You waste $1,000+ per bad location (machine cost + lost time + missed opportunity).

## SOCIAL PROOF SECTION

### Headline
**What Vending Operators Are Saying**

### What we're hearing from the community:

> Operators in forums like r/vending consistently report that bad location choices are the #1 reason machines fail. The most common complaints: trusting property manager foot traffic estimates, not checking competition within walking distance, and ignoring time-of-day patterns.

**Common pain points from real operator discussions:**

- "I placed a machine in what looked like a busy office building. Turns out everyone leaves by 4 PM and there's a Starbucks in the lobby."
- "Drove around for 3 hours scouting locations last weekend. Wish I could just pull up the data."
- "My best-performing machine is in a spot I almost skipped. My worst is where I was most confident."

## FAQ SECTION

### Q: Where does the foot traffic data come from?
**A:** We aggregate data from multiple sources (mobile location data, commercial foot traffic APIs, public transit data). It's not perfect, but it's 10x better than guessing. Beta users help us refine accuracy.

### Q: Does this work for all vending machine types?
**A:** Yes — snacks, drinks, combos, specialty (ice cream, healthy, etc.). The ROI calculator adjusts based on machine type and product margins.

### Q: I'm just starting out. Is this overkill?
**A:** Nope. If you're placing your first machine, this is *even more important*. You can't afford to waste $1,500 on a bad location. VendRadar pays for itself if it saves you from even one bad spot.

### Q: What if I already have machines placed?
**A:** Use VendRadar to analyze your current locations. You might find that moving a machine 2 blocks could double revenue. (We've seen it happen.)

### Q: Can I use this to negotiate with property owners?
**A:** 100%. Showing foot traffic data in a pitch meeting = way more credibility than "trust me, this will work."

### Q: Is there a free plan after beta?
**A:** We're considering it (probably limited to 3 searches/month). Priority right now is making sure the product is solid. Beta users will help decide pricing.

## EMAIL SEQUENCE (Post-Signup)

### Email 1: Welcome (Immediately after signup)
**Subject:** You're on the VendRadar beta list (Feb 24 launch)

**Body:**  
Hey [Name],

Thanks for signing up for VendRadar beta!

We're launching Feb 24 (one week from today). You'll get an email with your login link as soon as we go live.

In the meantime, here's a quick tip:

**The #1 location mistake vending operators make?**  
They trust "foot traffic" estimates from property managers. Managers always inflate numbers (they want your business).

Instead: Spend 1 hour sitting near the spot during peak hours. Count people yourself. You'll know instantly if it's legit.

See you on launch day,  
[Founder Name]
