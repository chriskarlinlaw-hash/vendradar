## SCRIPT

### HOOK (0:00 - 0:08)
**[VISUAL: Heat map overlay on screen]**

> "What if I told you that vending machine could make $500 a month instead of $50 — if you just placed it two blocks over?"

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side comparison: $50/month vs $500/month]**

> "Here's how to know before you waste money."

---

### PROBLEM (0:08 - 0:30)
**[VISUAL: Switch to talking head or continue screen recording]**

> "Most vending operators pick locations by gut feel. A manager says 'yeah, we get lots of foot traffic,' and you trust them."

**[VISUAL: Show fake "high traffic" promises — stock footage of crowded areas]**

> "But high traffic doesn't mean high sales. I've seen machines in malls with 10,000 people a day make less than machines in gyms with 500."

**[VISUAL: Show underperforming vending machine, then cut to screen]**

> "The problem? You're guessing. Let me show you a better way."

---

### SOLUTION (0:30 - 2:30)

#### Part 1: Enter a Location (0:30 - 0:50)
**[VISUAL: Screen recording — VendRadar dashboard]**

> "This is VendRadar. You type in any address or business name, and it shows you actual foot traffic data."

**[ACTION: Type "24 Fitness, Austin TX" into search bar]**

> "Let's say I'm thinking about placing a machine at a gym. I enter the location…"

**[VISUAL: Heat map loads]**

> "And boom — foot traffic heat map."

---

#### Part 2: Analyze the Data (0:50 - 1:30)
**[VISUAL: Click through different views]**

> "Now I can see exactly when people are here. Look — peak traffic is 5 to 8 PM on weekdays. Almost dead during the day."

**[VISUAL: Show hourly breakdown chart]**

> "That matters because if I'm stocking a snack machine, I want it there when people are actually around."

**[VISUAL: Click 'Demographics' tab]**

> "I can also see who's coming here. Age, income, spending patterns. This gym skews 25-35, medium income. Perfect for protein bars and energy drinks."

**[VISUAL: Click 'Competition' tab]**

> "And here's the kicker — it shows me nearby competition. There's a smoothie bar 50 feet away. That could hurt snack sales, but it probably won't affect drink sales."

---

#### Part 3: Compare Locations (1:30 - 2:00)
**[VISUAL: Click 'Compare' button, add second location]**

> "Now let's compare this gym to another location. I'll add an office building down the street."

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side comparison view]**

> "Office building has more traffic — but only during lunch hours. Gym has less total traffic, but it's consistent morning and evening."

**[VISUAL: Highlight ROI calculator]**

> "The ROI calculator estimates the gym will make $320 a month. The office? $180. Even though the office has 'more foot traffic.'"

---

#### Part 4: Make the Decision (2:00 - 2:30)
**[VISUAL: Click 'Save Location' button]**

> "So now I know: gym is the better spot. I can place my machine confidently, negotiate with the owner using real data, and actually make money."

**[VISUAL: Show saved locations list]**

> "I can save locations, track them over time, and keep scouting for new opportunities."

**[VISUAL: Cut back to talking head or keep screen]**

> "This is what location scouting should have been all along. Data, not guesses."

---

### CTA (2:30 - 3:00)
**[VISUAL: Talking head or text overlay on screen]**

> "VendRadar is launching Feb 24th. I'm offering free beta access to the first 50 vending operators."

**[VISUAL: Show signup form or website URL]**

> "If you operate vending machines — or you're thinking about starting — sign up at vendradar.com. Link in the description."

**[VISUAL: Show testimonial or data insight]**

> "One beta tester moved a machine based on VendRadar data. Revenue went up 40% in one month. That's what happens when you stop guessing."

**[VISUAL: End screen with URL + CTA]**

> "See you on launch day."

### TikTok / Instagram Reels (15-30 sec versions)

- CTA: "Link in bio for free tool"

**Version 2: Curiosity gap**
- Hook: "Vending operators don't talk about this…"
- Show: Screen recording of hidden competition feature
- CTA: "Try it free → vendradar.com"
