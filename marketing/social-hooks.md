## CONTENT FRAMEWORKS (Pair with Hooks)

### Framework 1: Problem → Agitation → Solution
**Example:**
- Hook: "Why your vending machine makes $50/month instead of $500."
- Problem: "You placed it in a 'busy' gym. Looks crowded, right?"
- Agitation: "But people go straight to their workout. Nobody stops. Dead money."
- Solution: "VendRadar shows foot traffic + dwell time. See which spots people actually linger. Link in bio."

---

### Framework 2: Curiosity Gap → Reveal → CTA
**Example:**
- Hook: "I analyzed 500 vending locations. The results surprised me."
- Reveal 1: "Malls = overrated. Too much competition, low dwell time."
- Reveal 2: "College libraries = goldmine. Students linger, impulse buyers."
- Reveal 3: "Office buildings = hit or miss. Depends on lunch hour traffic."
- CTA: "Want to analyze your location? Try VendRadar free → link in bio."

---

### Framework 3: Contrarian Take → Proof → CTA
**Example:**
- Hook: "Hot take: 'High foot traffic' is the worst metric."
- Proof: "I placed a machine in a mall food court. 10,000 people/day. Made $60/month."
- Proof: "Then I placed one in a gym locker room. 500 people/day. Made $350/month."
- Insight: "Dwell time > raw traffic."
- CTA: "See foot traffic + dwell time data for any location → vendradar.com"

---

### Framework 4: Story → Twist → Lesson
**Example:**
- Hook: "Three years ago I bought my first vending machine."
- Story: "Gym parking lot. Manager said 'you'll make a killing.' Made $50/month."
- Twist: "I moved it 2 blocks to a college library. Same machine. $320/month."
- Lesson: "Location isn't about busy. It's about *right* busy."
- CTA: "Find your $320/month location → link in bio"

## ENGAGEMENT HOOKS (For Comments/Replies)

When someone comments on your post, keep them engaged:

**If they ask "Does this work for [X type of machine]?"**
> "Yep! Works for snack, drink, combo, even specialty machines. ROI calculator adjusts based on machine type."

**If they share a bad location story:**
> "Oof, been there. That's exactly why I built this — nobody should waste money on 'trust me it's busy' promises. Want me to analyze your location for free?"

**If they're skeptical:**
> "Totally fair. I was skeptical of data tools too until I lost $2K on bad spots. If you want to test it before signing up, DM me a location and I'll run the analysis for free."

**If they ask about pricing:**
> "Right now it's free (beta launch this week). After that, probably $29-49/month. Want to make sure it's worth it first."

## VIRALITY CHECKLIST

A post is more likely to go viral if it has:

✅ **Emotional trigger:** Frustration (lost money), curiosity (secret revealed), hope (solution exists)  
✅ **Concrete numbers:** "$50 vs $500", "40% increase", "2 blocks away"  
✅ **Relatability:** "We've all been there" moment  
✅ **Shareability:** Would an operator send this to a friend?  
✅ **Clear CTA:** "Try VendRadar free" not "Learn more about our revolutionary platform"  

---

## TESTING STRATEGY

1. **Post 3 versions** of the same content with different hooks (TikTok A, Reels B, Shorts C)
2. **Track metrics:**
   - Views
   - Watch time (%)
   - Likes/comments
   - Link clicks (UTM tracking)
3. **Double down** on what works (if Hook A gets 5K views, make 3 more like it)
4. **Kill what doesn't** (if a format gets <500 views, pivot)

---

## EMERGENCY HOOK (If Nothing Lands)

If your first 5-7 posts flop, pivot to hyper-specific storytelling:

**Hook:**
> "I'm launching a vending location tool this week. Here's what happened when I tested it on real operators."

**Body:**
- Tell a real story (operator moved machine, revenue went up)
- Show screenshots/data
- Be vulnerable ("I was nervous launching this. Then Mike sent me this…")

**Why this works:** Authenticity > polish. People trust real stories over marketing.
