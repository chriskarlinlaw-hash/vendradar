## Problem Statement

### The Pain Point
Starting a vending machine business requires $5,000-25,000 upfront investment per machine. Location is everything - a machine in a high-traffic area can generate $300-500/month profit, while a poor location loses money.

**Current situation:**
- Entrepreneurs rely on gut feel and visual inspection
- No data-driven way to assess locations
- 30-40% of new machines placed in suboptimal locations
- Average loss per bad placement: $5,000-15,000

### Market Validation
- Vending industry forums show constant questions about location selection
- Existing vending operators pay $200-500 for location scouting services
- No self-service digital tool exists
- Growing interest in "passive income" vending businesses (YouTube, TikTok)

---

## Recommendation

**Build if:**
- You want a capital-efficient, scalable SaaS

**Don't build if:**
- You want quick revenue (12 months to profitability)
- You don't want to learn a niche industry
- API costs scare you

**Overall assessment:** Solid niche SaaS with clear problem/solution fit. Lower risk than Follow Up Fox but also lower ceiling. Good lifestyle business potential.
